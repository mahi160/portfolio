# Pre NeoVim

From the beginning of my journey as a software engineer, I’ve been a VS Code (or Codium or Code-OSS) user — my finger muscles are deep in it (_that's what..._). I’ve always loved the idea of a minimalist, fast, keyboard-driven text editor. So when I first heard about Vim, I had to give it a try.

Back then, Windows was my main OS (**I KNOW!!**), and Linux was my secondary. One day, I opened up Vim in the terminal... and ended up reinstalling my entire Linux partition because I couldn’t figure out [how to exit Vim](/blog/quit-neovim).

As time went on, I fully switched over to Linux. For day-to-day config changes, I mostly used Nano. But one day, I gave Vim another shot — and around that time, I discovered a newer tool called **Neovim**. I learned a few basic keybindings, and that was it... for a while.

Gradually, though, I started to fall in love with Neovim. Still, I was deeply integrated into my VS Code workflow and wasn’t quite ready to move away from it completely. One of my colleagues was a hardcore Neovim + tmux user, and every time I saw him code, it was just... fast. I’m also a big fan of [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen). So, in a way, all the paths I followed as a dev converged into a single point.

It's finally decided: I’m going all in. I’m committing myself to **Neovim**!
